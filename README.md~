Note that this is the code for Gaussian NPN to run on the MNIST and Boston
Housing datasets. For Gamma NPN or Poisson NPN please go to the other repo.

To train the model, run the command:
'cd example'
to go to the directory of the entry point and run
'./run.sh'  or  'sh run.sh'

example/run.sh: entry point
mlp_bayes.m: core model code
default_mlp_bayes.m: initialize NPN

PyTorch version of the NPN will be released soon.
